## Machine readable license models for mobility solutions

This specification describes how an agency that regulates mobility can describe the rules that need to be fulfulled in order that the mobility provider can operate in the defined zone.
(heavely based on the work of Brechtvdv: https://brechtvdv.github.io/third-party-support-maas-specification/)

## Multi modal journeys

A user is entitled for payment when all Criteria is met. For a multi modal journey, this means that there is one Criterion for every route segment, which represents one modality. Strict order of criteria is currently not supported. 
```
"hasCriterion": [{
		"@type": "Criterion",
		"isFulfilledBy": [{
			...
		},
		"@type": "Criterion",
		"isFulfilledBy": [{
			...
		}],
		...
		}
	}]
```
