# About Common Shared Mobility License Framework

These pages are a first setup in the creating of a "universal" shared mobility licence framework. The goal of this framework is to create a tool for cities and regions that make it easy to define the parameters that could/should be implemented in their licensen. The framework for the moment is setup as a discussion document to find a common ground between legislation, private players and the public.

**Disclaimer:** The ideas in this document are just that, ideas. There still need to be done legal checks and operational checks before they can be implemented.
