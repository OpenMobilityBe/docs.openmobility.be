# License Requirements

### Number of providers

There are various reasons to limit the number of providers in a city or region but sometimes it might be interesting to not limit it. However, it is important to mention in the license agreement that it is always possible for a city/region to implement a limitation on the number of providers. 

### Number of vehicles

As a city or a region it is important to make sure that societal goals are reached. The value of the public domain can not be overestimated and therefore keeping the possibility to limit the number of shared vehicles can be needed. Putting a limit on the number of vehicles can also reduce the chance of price wars and dumping.

### Location constraints

There are many factors at play in a city/region. Both from an operational point of view as from a user point of view it might be important to impose some constraints and guidance in certain areas.

#### Drop-off zones

Drop-off zones can be defined as a suggestion \(rewarding if vehicle is dropped-off in that area\) or as a requirement \(vehicle needs to be dropped-off in that zone\). Depending on the local situation, it can also be an option to not define drop-off zones and leave it to the service providers to define the zones. By defining drop-off zones together with the players a good balance can be found between designing the public domain and optimizing the zones based on usage data from the providers.

#### Operational Zones

Defining operational zones in a license model has several advantages. The main advantage of defining shared operational zones is uniformity towards end-users. If we want to come to seamless travel, those zones should not be variable among players.

#### No-Go zones

No-Go zones are zones where the vehicles are not allowed including driving through them. 

#### Concentration Zones

Concentration zones are areas where you want a higher concentration of vehicles because of the importance of that mobility node. This can be made dynamic in time \(events\) or fixed \(train stations\).

### Duration of the license

Licenses can be limited in time. A good and workable duration of a license is 3 years but it is also important to keep in mind that we're living in a fast moving world and that reviews of the basic parameters can be considered/implemented during those 3 years. 

### Average usage of vehicles

An important metric to measure the performance of a shared mobility provider is to define a minimal usage per vehicle. This can be calculated over the whole fleet or on every vehicle.

### Action plan

\(tbd\)

### End-of-life/exit strategy

Companies change fast and strategies of those organisations can change even faster. Therefore it is important to make sure the mobility provider has also considered worst case scenarios. What happens to the users if the company goes belly-up, will/can they transfer to one of the other providers without a problem,... It can be made a requirement to provide such a scenario. 

### Cost/Reward

In some areas, many players want to start in others the government want to attract players. Adding a price or reward to a license can help cover some of the cost linked to shared mobility or can make it more interesting for players to roll-out their system in a certain area. There are various fixed and variable models that can be developed.

#### Fixed price for a license

A fixed price/reward could be put on a license. Operators can buy a license which gives them the right to operate in the defined operation zone\(s\).

#### Per vehicle charge/reward

In some cities, a price per vehicle is defined. Most often this is a fixed price. 

#### Per trip charge/reward

Pricing per trip can be considered although it should be taken into account that higher usage should be rewarded.
