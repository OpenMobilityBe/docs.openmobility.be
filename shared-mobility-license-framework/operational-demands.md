# Operational Demands

## Quality towards users

The goal of all players in the mobility ecosystem should be to provide the user with a positive and seamless user experience. This is key to make multimodal transport a serious option an a regular basis. Therefore it is important to make sure mobility providers align with this goal and provide a minimal addition to that user experience.

### Service desk

Since many things can go wrong, it might be considered to require a service desk/single point of contact in case of problems. 

### Web/App

\(tbd\)

### Insurance

A certain requirement is to make sure an operator has the proper insurances in place.

### GDPR

Obviously privacy is a big concern. It should be clear that the operator follows the GDPR-rules as set out by the EU and has the proper tools in-place for compliance.

### Multilingual

It can be considered to require the communication to be available in multiple languages. 

### No ads on vehicles

Publicity \(except for the own brand\) can be a hinderance on the vehicle or can have other implications. It can be considered to not allow ads on vehicles.

## Quality of vehicles

### Replacement

### Maintenance

In some cities, it is required to provide maintenance records to the government to make sure there's a regular maintenance \(min 1x month\) of the vehicles. In others it's just defined that vehicles should be maintained regularly. To provide a safe and positive user experience it is important that vehicles are well maintained and function properly at all time. 

### Compliance to traffic regulations

All vehicles have to comply with traffic regulations and have the proper CE-approvals. It is also important that an operator informs its users about the correct use of the vehicles in a clear way. This can be part of the license agreement.

## Quality of operations

### No hindrance

Parking the vehicles should not cause hindrance to other road users. The operator should have systems in place \(including proper communication about the traffic regulations\) to make sure hindrance in the public domain is minimal. Proper contact information can be made required on the vehicles themselves \(or not\). 

### Spread

A requirement can be that the operator makes sure that the vehicles are spread over the operational zone in a uniform/predefined way. This to make sure that equal access to the mobility solutions is ensured. 

### Continuity of offer

Users will start to depend on the availability of the vehicles. A requirement could be to define a minimal availability of vehicles, a maximum unavailability \(without replacement\) of a vehicle etc.
